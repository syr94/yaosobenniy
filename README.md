## Description

The Children Education Management System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the management of children with disabilities and their education. The system allows parents, teachers, and fund employees to collaborate and track the educational progress of the children.

## Features

    - Teachers: Teachers have their own personal accounts where they can view their teaching schedules and the specific children they worked with on particular days and times.
    - Fund Employees: Fund employees have access to information on both parents and children, allowing them to monitor the overall progress and performance of the children.
- Lesson Management:
    - Teachers can create and manage lessons, assigning them to specific children.
    - Lessons include information about the teacher, child, address, and company.
